This section goes over many different tools used by professionals. I will cover the tool, what uses it provides, and what scenarios to use them in. I will provide a guide on how to use the tool, as well. I'm going to prioritize free/open-source tools, but I will cover some paid tools. I'm not being endorsed or paid for these, so I strive to remain unbiased. I am not trying to sell a product. These tools are tools that I have heard referenced many times. My exposure is limited, of course, so I may miss some. Don't let this list be the only tools you use. Feel free to look at tools yourself and learn. This is to help get your feet wet.
