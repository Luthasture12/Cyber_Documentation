# Purpose
This project is to hold knowledge, examples, and other resources for people to use while learning cybersecurity. The goal is to consolidate a lot of information into one place, to make learning more convenient.

Includes a lot of details that may not be required, but it tries to give as much detail as possible while keeping it in simple terminology.

# Sections
* Computer Functionality
    * This section covers aspects directly related to computer fundamentals. Pretty vague, but it gets you accustomed to different parts of the computer, how it runs, and other basic information. Knowing some basic parts of a computer gives a nice background to help with some cyber tools and techniques.
* Encryption
    * This one is a difficult subject with a lot of math if you get in depth. However, knowing some basic fundamentals will be helpful in knowing how it works, why it works, and what to do on your end. There are different encryption methods that I will go over. NOTE: due to powerful computation technology that's getting developed and released, encryption is in a point of vulnerability and big discussion of what to do. I'm not an expert on this subject, so I don't have any contribution to that discussion. I'll give a brief summary of the issue at large, though.
* Networks
    * This is more of an IT thing in general. However, this is general information that will give a good background and may be of assistance. It can help a lot with Capture-the-Flags and analysis skills. I go over network setup, as well as data  that gets sent over the network (packets, ports, protocols).
* Risk Analysis and Assessment
    * This section is less on the technical side and more on the policy side. However, knowing risk can help with defense (knowing what to protect) and offense (knowing what to attack) in practice. This section will cover assigning risk than actual implemention of anything technical.
* Terminology
    * There's a lot of jargon that can get used in conversations. This section helps serve as a dictionary of sorts that you can refer to if someone uses a term or acronym that you are unfamiliar with.
* Tools
    * This section goes over many different tools used by professionals. I will cover the tool, what uses it provides, and what scenarios to use them in. I will provide a guide on how to use the tool, as well. I'm going to prioritize free/open-source tools, but I will cover some paid tools. I'm not being endorsed or paid for these, so I strive to remain unbiased. I am not trying to sell a product. These tools are tools that I have heard referenced many times. My exposure is limited, of course, so I may miss some. Don't let this list be the only tools you use. Feel free to look at tools yourself and learn. This is to help get your feet wet.
