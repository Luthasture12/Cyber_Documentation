# Encryption

This one is a difficult subject with a lot of math if you get in depth. However, knowing some basic fundamentals will be helpful in knowing how it works, why it works, and what to do on your end. There are different encryption methods that I will go over.

I'm not an expert on this subject, so I don't have any contribution to that discussion. I'll give a brief summary of the issue at large, though
